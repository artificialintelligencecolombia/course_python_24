# 2 open the .txt file to obtain the list_quotes of quotes
# 3 Use random module to pick a random quote form list_quotes of quotes.
# 4. Use smtlib to send email 


# 1. GET THE CURRENT DAY OF THE WEEK
import datetime as dt

now = dt.datetime.now() # Prints the current datetime
day_of_week = now.weekday() # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# ------------------------------ SOLUTION --------------------------------
# Daniel M. approach
# 1. Get and save today's date and the day of the week
# 2. open and read the .txt file.
# 3. get the quotes from the file, process them and save them in a list.
