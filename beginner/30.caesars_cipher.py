# Caesar's cipher.
#
# 1: Create a function called 'encrypt' that takes the 'text' and 'shift' as inputs.
# 2: Inside the 'encrypt' function, shift each letter of the 'text' forwards in the alphabet by the shift amount and print the encrypted text.  
# e.g. 
# plain_text = "hello"
# shift = 5
# cipher_text = "mjqqt"
# print output: "The encoded text is mjqqt"

# 3: Call the encrypt function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message.
